## Overview

HYDRAPET leverages MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) for efficient and lightweight communication between the ESP32-based device and external clients or controllers. The system subscribes to specific topics to receive commands and publishes messages to other topics to relay status updates and alerts.

## Published MQTT Topics

Published topics are those that HYDRAPET sends messages to, providing status updates, alerts, or other relevant information.

### 1. `hydrapet0001/hydrapetinfo/watertanklevel`

**Description:**

Publishes the current status of the water tank level. The message will be:

- `"Below 30%"` if the variable `s_water_level_state` is `0`.

**Payload Formats:**

- **Plain Text:**

    ```
    Below 30%
    ```

    or

    ```
    Water tank is full
    ```

**Automatic Publishing:**

The system automatically publishes to this topic based on the state of `s_water_level_state`. This can be configured to occur at regular intervals (e.g., every minute) or triggered by specific events such as changes in water level.

**Example Messages:**

- **Below 30%:**

    ```bash
    mosquitto_pub -h broker.mosquitto.org -t "hydrapet0001/hydrapetinfo/watertanklevel" -m "Below 30%"
    ```

- **Water Tank is Full:**

    ```bash
    mosquitto_pub -h broker.mosquitto.org -t "hydrapet0001/hydrapetinfo/watertanklevel" -m "Water tank is full"
    ```

**Use Case:**

Subscribers can monitor this topic to receive real-time updates on the water tank's status, enabling timely actions such as refilling or alerting users.

---

### 2. `hydrapet0001/hydrapetinfo/watertank`

**Description:**

Publishes alerts related to the water tank status, particularly when dispensing fails.

**Payload Formats:**

- **Plain Text:**

    ```
    empty
    ```

**Device Response:**

- Publishes `"empty"` when the dispensing process fails, indicating that the water tank might be empty or the dispensing mechanism is malfunctioning.

**Example Message:**

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h broker.mosquitto.org -t "hydrapet0001/hydrapetinfo/watertank" -m "empty"
```

**Use Case:**

## Notes

1. **Message Formats:**
   - Ensure that the payloads are correctly formatted as per the topic requirements. Incorrect formats may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
   - For setting time, water levels, and alarms, JSON format is preferred for clarity and extensibility.

2. **Water Tank Level Monitoring:**
   - The `hydrapet0001/hydrapetinfo/watertanklevel` topic provides real-time status of the water tank.
   - Ensure that `s_water_level_state` is correctly updated in your code based on sensor readings.

3. **Synchronization of Time:**
   - Accurate system time is crucial for alarm functionalities. Consider integrating SNTP for automatic time synchronization.

4. **MQTT Security:**
   - Public brokers like `broker.mosquitto.org` are suitable for testing. For production, use a secure, private broker with authentication and TLS encryption.

5. **Resource Management:**
   - ESP32 has limited resources. Optimize MQTT message sizes and frequency to prevent resource exhaustion.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - The system logs errors for debugging. Consider adding additional MQTT notifications for critical errors.

7. **Extensibility:**
   - The modular design allows for easy addition of new features, such as integrating more sensors or actuators.

8. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test each MQTT topic and its corresponding functionality in a controlled environment before deploying to production.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Keep the documentation updated as new features and topics are added to ensure clarity for users and developers.
